This program implements an RPG game: Legends of Valor, where the player form a team of three heroes
to fight against a team of monsters (controlled by computer). Heroes are placed on three different
lanes and for each round the player would choose the action for each hero (moving, fighting, teleporting etc.).
Once a hero breaks through monsters' defenses and reaches the opponent's base (Nexus), it counts as a win;
otherwise if a monster reaches hero's base, the player loses.

Execution:
>javac *.java
>java Main.java
